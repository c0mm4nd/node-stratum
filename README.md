# node-stratum

Designed for one-algorithm bitcoin-fork pool.

High performance Stratum poolserver in Node.js. One instance of this software can startup and manage multiple coin
pools, each with their own daemon and stratum port :)

Supporting all algorithms based on the `node-hashing-algo` lib series.

## Notice

This is a module for Node.js that will do nothing on its own. Unless you're a Node.js developer who would like to
handle stratum authentication and raw share data then this module will not be of use to you. For a full featured portal

## Features

- Daemon RPC interface
- Stratum TCP socket server
- Block template / job manager
- P2P to get block notifications as peer node
- Optimized generation transaction building
- Connecting to multiple daemons for redundancy
- Process share submissions
- Session managing for purging DDoS/flood initiated zombie workers
- Auto ban IPs that are flooding with invalid shares
- __POW__ (proof-of-work) & __POS__ (proof-of-stake) support
- Transaction messages support
- Vardiff (variable difficulty / share limiter)
- When started with a coin deamon that hasn't finished syncing to the network it shows the blockchain download progress and initializes once synced

## Requirements

- NodeJS **>= v13**
- Coin daemon (preferably one with a relatively updated API and not some crapcoin :p)

## Example Usage

### Install as a node module by cloning repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maoxs2/node-stratum node_modules/node-stratum
npm update
```

### Module usage

Create the configuration for your coin:

Possible options for `algorithm`: *sha256, scrypt, scrypt-jane, scrypt-n, quark, x11, keccak, blake,
skein, groestl, fugue, shavite3, hefty1, qubit, or sha1*.

```javascript
const myCoin = {
    "name": "Dogecoin",
    "symbol": "DOGE",
    "algorithm": "scrypt",
    "nValue": 1024, //optional - defaults to 1024
    "rValue": 1, //optional - defaults to 1
    "txMessages": false, //optional - defaults to false,

    /* Magic value only required for setting up p2p block notifications. It is found in the daemon
       source code as the pchMessageStart variable.
       For example, litecoin mainnet magic: http://git.io/Bi8YFw
       And for litecoin testnet magic: http://git.io/NXBYJA */
     "peerMagic": "fbc0b6db", //optional
     "peerMagicTestnet": "fcc1b7dc", //optional
};
```

Create and start new pool with configuration options and authentication function

```javascript
const createPool = require('node-stratum');

const poolConfig = {
    "coin": myCoin,

    "address": "mi4iBXbBsydtcc5yFmsff2zCFVX4XG7qJc", //Address to where block rewards are given

    /* Block rewards go to the configured pool wallet address to later be paid out to miners,
       except for a percentage that can go to, for examples, pool operator(s) as pool fees or
       or to donations address. Addresses or hashed public keys can be used. Here is an example
       of rewards going to the main pool op, a pool co-owner, and NOMP donation. */

           your config to help support NOMP development. */
